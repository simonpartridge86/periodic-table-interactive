Periodic Table app plan

- Find suitable open API that provides periodic table data ✅
- Take a Next.js with Typescript tutorial to learn how to combine the two ✅
- Apply these principles to this periodic table app - importing data as static props ✅
- Use data to render unformatted periodic table on homepage ✅
- Use dynamic routing with static paths to generate separate info pages for each element ✅

- Decide which data to display on individual element pages
- Create "groups" page, which displays element by group
  - requires filter function(s) and introduction of appropriate titles
- Work out how to style full periodic table
  - CSS grid?
  - Filter data to introduce "empty" elements into row?
  - Need to color code based on element type (groupBlock attribute) ✅
- Create navbar to go between full and group views - maybe use new Next13 layouts?
- Further styling issues:
  - how to handle mobile view? (reduce by vertical height and allow scrolling left to right?)
